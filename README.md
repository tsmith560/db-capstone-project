# Little Lemon Database Project

This project includes:

- A normalized relational schema for Little Lemon’s business data
- SQL queries for business insights
- Stored procedures and prepared statements
- Version control with Git and GitHub

## Tasks Completed
Part 1:
- ✅ Task 1: Created a virtual table to summarize data 
- ✅ Task 2: Join across customers, orders, and menu items
- ✅ Task 3: Subquery to find popular menu items

Part 2:
- ✅ Task 1: Stored procedure to get max quantity ordered
- ✅ Task 2: 
- ✅ Task 3: 


Note on Schema Differences:
Due to the lack of specific schema requirements in the course materials, I designed a normalized schema based on the data available and the project goals. My schema contains all necessary entities (Orders, Customers, MenuItems, and the relationships between them), even if table names differ. All assigned queries were implemented successfully using this design.
